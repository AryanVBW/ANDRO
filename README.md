    - `npm install pm2 -g`

4. Download and Extract the latest release from [HERE](https://github.com/AryanVBW/ANDRO/releases/download/V.1/L3MON-2024.zip)

5. In the extracted folder, run these commands
    - `npm install` <- install dependencies
    - `pm2 start index.js` <-- start the script
    - `pm2 startup` <- to run ANDRO on startup

6. Set a Username & Password
    1. Stop ANDRO `pm2 stop index`
    2. Open `maindb.json` in a text editor
    3. under `admin` 
        - set the `username` as plain text {Default is aryan}
        - set the `password` as a LOWERCASE MD5 hash {default pass is ANDRO}
    4. save the file
    5. run `pm2 restart all`

7. in your browser navigate to `http://<SERVER IP>:22533`
