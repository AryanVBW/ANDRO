2. Install NodeJS [Instructions Here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/) (If you can't figure this out, you shouldn't really be using this)

3. install PM2 
    - `npm install pm2 -g`

4. Download and Extract the latest release from [HERE]()

5. In the extracted folder, run these commands
    - `npm install` <- install dependencies
    - `pm2 start index.js` <-- start the script
    - `pm2 startup` <- to run L3MON on startup

6. Set a Username & Password
    1. Stop L3MON `pm2 stop index`
    2. Open `maindb.json` in a text editor
    3. under `admin` 
        - set the `username` as plain text
        - set the `password` as a LOWERCASE MD5 hash
    4. save the file
    5. run `pm2 restart all`

7. in your browser navigate to `http://<SERVER IP>:22533`
    
It's recommended to run L3MON behind a reverse proxy such as [NGINX](https://www.nginx.com/resources/wiki/start/topics/tutorials/install/)

## Notes
When opening an issue, you **MUST** use the provided templates. Issues without this will not recieve support quickly and will be put to the bottom of the figurative pile.

Please have a look through the current issues, open and closed to see if your issue has been addressed before. If it's java related, it's most definitely been addressed - In short Use Java 1.8.0
